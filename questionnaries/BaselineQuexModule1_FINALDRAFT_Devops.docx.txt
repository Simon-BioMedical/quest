   Figure 7 – Significant hair loss from the temple areas of the sides of the head, extending as far backwards to be in line with the back of the ears and with a small area of hair loss on the crown of the head. These two areas of hair loss are separated by a band of moderately dense hair that extends across the top of the head
   Figure 8 – Significant hair loss from the temple areas of the sides of the head, extending as far backwards to be in line with the back of the ears and with a moderate-sized area of hair loss on the crown of the head.
