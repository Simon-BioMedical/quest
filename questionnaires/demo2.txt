[INTROM1] Welcome, {$u:firstName}! This survey will ask you about a wide range of topics, such as your medical conditions, water usage, sleep habits, and more. Our goal is to gather information about your life and behaviors. You can answer all of the questions now, or you can answer some questions now and answer the rest later. Your answers will be saved and you can pick up where you left off. You can also skip any questions that you do not want to answer.
